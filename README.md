# Frontend Challenge: December Edition

Dev Challenge - December - Glam Up My Markup

_This is a submission for [Frontend Challenge - December Edition, Glam Up My Markup: Winter Solstice](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend-2024-12-04)_

## What I Built

I created an interactive and responsive landing page about the Winter Solstice

<!-- Tell us about your landing page and what you were looking to achieve. -->

## Demo

<!-- Show us your project! You can directly embed an editor into this post (see the FAQ section from the challenge page) or you can share an image of your project and share a public link to the code. -->

## Journey

**Step 1: Styling the navbar and footer**

I used css grid for the overall page and css flexbox to layout the links in the navigation bar. Finally I used a media query to stack up the navigation links when displayed on smaller screens.

It was interesting learning the importance of this viewport meta tag to make the page responsive

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

**Step 2: Switching between tabs**

This second step involved using javascript to toggle the display of each section depending on which navigation link was clicked/active. This gives it the interactivity of navigating between different pages
