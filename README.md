## What I Built

I created an interactive and responsive landing page about the Winter Solstice

<!-- Tell us about your landing page and what you were looking to achieve. -->

## Demo

<!-- Show us your project! You can directly embed an editor into this post (see the FAQ section from the challenge page) or you can share an image of your project and share a public link to the code. -->

## Journey

**Step 1: Styling the navbar and footer**

I started with using flexbox to style the navigation bar and footer and using a media query to stack up the navigation links on smaller screens.

It was interesting learning the importance of this viewport meta tag to make the page responsive

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```
